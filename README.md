# Online-Examination-System
I have designed a simple and basic online examination system. 
It is implemented using Basic Java , HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java Servlets, SQL and Java Database Connectivity.
If you have just started working on Full Stack JAVA and you have no idea how to start integrating all the concepts together.
This is for you.
